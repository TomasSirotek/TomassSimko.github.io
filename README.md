## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### Bootstrap Framework

Using card component shorted the process of development. Using Flex within Bootstrap helped me quickly manage the layout, alignment and sizing of grid columns. I have found out Bootstrap really useful even in other projects I will study and research more of this framework .

#### HTML Component Structure

Within building this projects I have learnered how to properly write and style basic structure of the component from Bootstrap .

### Sass 

Creating style for the component I have learned basics of Sass where I was able to seperate all the scss files and created simple individual files and use basics like Nesting etc.. . Using sass was benefit for the whole work flow and made the code with the bootstrap framework shorter and better readable.

### !important

 To overwrite default components or div within bootstrap I had to use !important. From what I found out and learned is not always good idea to do. An alternative way might be moving all utilities to the end of css order. That would override most of the other global specificity or general utilities.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Flex](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/flex/) - This helped me improve the appearance of the component on the page.

- [!Important](https://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/) - This article helped me better understand !Important use.
